# ghostwriter2-themes

A repo to host themes for [Ghostwriter 2](https://wereturtle.github.io/ghostwriter/).

Currently just contains a [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) dark/light theme as that's the the only theme I care about. People are welcome to contribute their own conversions.

You can just clone this repo to `~/.config/ghostwriter/themes` and hopefully the app will pick up the new themes.
